class Share:
    """
    Share class for holding a single share of a Shamir (k of n) threshold
    scheme. Each share is a coordinate, with an (x, y) value, where x is an
    integer, greater than 1. The secret key is the y value at x = 0. A checksum
    of the key is the value at x = 1. Share values start at x = 2.

    One share is 37 bytes, represented as 27 words. Each word is 11 bits. The
    297th bit from the last word is truncated. The first 32 bytes encode the
    y value of the share. The next byte is the original seed's checksum. The
    next 2 bytes hold  the version, threshold, and x value of the share. The
    version is 5 bits, starting with a value of 0; the threshold is 4 bits,
    starting at 2; and the x value is 7 bits, starting at 2. The last 2 bytes
    are a checksum of the share. Finally, the share checksum is applied as an
    xor to the prior 2-bytes containing the version, threshold, and x value in
    order to avoid long sequences of zeros.

    296-bit share structure:
    [256: Y value]

    [5: Version xor checksum]
    [4: Threshold xor checksum]
    [7: X value xor checksum]
